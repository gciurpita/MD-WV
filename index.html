The 100x60ft layout has the following shape
with interior and surrounding aisles for vistors
during weekend and weeklong (county fair) open houses.

<p>
The layout
has two multi-track mainlines with reversing loops at each end,
designed for open houses with continuous running.
These mainlines model the B&amp;O and Western Maryland
from Cumberland to Connelsville.
It includes the Cumberland engine terminal and
recently completed multi-track freight house.

<p>
The layout uses a Digitrak control system
composed of a DB210 command station and three separate ???  boosters.
Each mainline is divided into 8 blocks
with PSX/PSXX circuit breakers for each block and in each direction
with PSX-ARs managing the reversing loops.

<p>
Almost all turnouts are controlled from from the DT602d controllers
using DS-64 stationary decodes and Tortoise machines

<p>
A limited amount of signaling is implented use ESP-32 processor
and PSX/PSXX block detection.
The ESP-32s share block occupancy information via WiFi.
A wall mounted display shows block occupancy on both mainlines
with white LEDs,
as well as when shorts are detected using red LEDs.
